# Anticipated Developer Workflow Document

1. Get working node/bower
2. Build virtualenv
3. Checkout application
4. Test
5. Setup database
6. Edit/Make Changes/Test
7. If you changed JS, save vendor_packages
8. Commit

## Getting a new copy

`git clone git@github.com:edac-epscor/nmepscor-data-collection-form.git`

## Building your development environment


Now, your development environment will probably have dependencies beyond what's
here (installing django-bower for example), will require bower.  Bower will
require node and npm.  The easiest way to actually have this work on Ubuntu is
*NEVER* to use the ubuntu node package, but instead to use the creepy way...

(If you use the Ubuntu package, node will be called nodejs, as node is a different
command.  Installing node /locally/ will override this if you have appropriate
bashrc settings.  Otherwise, bower will fail as the npm package shebangs
/bin/node... TLDR: when building your desktop environment, make sure the bower
command actually works)

```bash
curl -L https://npmjs.org/install.sh | sh
sudo npm cache clean -f
sudo npm install -g n # get latest stable node
sudo n stable  # use latest stable node
sudo npm install -g bower  # get bower
```

Be sure bower works when you type `bower` on the command line...

Now we're going to build our python virtualenv and get the project configured

```bash
cd /workspace
virtualenv --no-site-packages projectname
source bin/activate
git clone git@github.com:edac-epscor/nmepscor-data-collection-form.git
cd nmepscor-data-collection-form
pip install -r requirements/local.list
cd application
```

You /should/ be able to type `python manage.py bower_install` and have no
changes happen, as all of the vendor javascript files should presently be in
this git repo.

Now you will have to get the database setup according to your needs.

```bash
vim base/settings/local.py
python manage.py test
python manage.py syncdb
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```

* If you made database changes, remember to run migrations.
* If you changed javascript, make sure you ran bower_install
* Save all of the above to the subversion repo.  At some point, this should be a /prod/ branch
..* And of course, don't forget to change settings.production if appropriate

## Deploy to staging

Use our svn://ansible/epscorform.yml against test-server
`ansible-playbook -i single-server epscorform.yml`

## Deploy to prod

Not yet written as it's not decided what host this is on.  Probably a one time
occurrence as we won't be deploying that server with a new MySQL or Drupal
installation any time in the anticipated future.

## Update prod

1. Backups backups backups
2. Stop Apache
3. Checkout new copy of source tree
4. `python manage.py syncdb` Run syncdb if appropriate
5. `python manage.py migrate` Run migrations if appropriate
6. `python manage.py collectstatic`  (you did check updated vendorJS in right?)
7. Start Apache
